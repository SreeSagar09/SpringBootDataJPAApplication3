A Program to show some simple methods to retrieve records from DB:
Programs:
* SpringBootDataJPAApplication1Application.java
* Employee.java
* EmployeeRepository.java
* TestRunner.java
Notes:
* The QueryByExampleExecutor interface is to allow execution of Query by Example instances.
* The Example interface is used to Support for query by example (QBE). An Example takes a properties to define the example.
* The ExampleMatcher interface is used for property path matching to use in query by example (QBE).
Output:
From run method in TestRunner class.
